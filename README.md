# Battleships Project
## Guidance on how to play the game
**Objective**  
Need to talk to Iyanu about how the points system works and write this here  
Sink all your opponents ships before they sink yours  
  
**Game modes**  
**1vs Computer-** individual player battles an AI opponent with different difficulties, easy, medium and hard  
**Multiplayer-** two or more (write how many at the end here) players battle at the same computer  
  
**Rules**    
 - Each player has a square grid (size depending on player's choice at the start of the game) of ships with varying sizes
 - Players take turns clicking on the opponent's grid
 - Hits are marked as this--- misses are marked as this--- and play this sound etc
 - The first player to sink all the opponents ships first wins... also talk about scoring here
   
## App controls and walkthrough
**Controls**  
**Mouser clicks-** used to place ships, selecting squares of the othe player's board, click through the menus  
**Keyboard-** used to input player names, (if selected) to select squares to sink ships and place ships  
  
**Walkthrough**
1. Launch game
2. 

The start button takes you to the initial screen...Once start is pressed  
The settings button takes you to where you can select different difficulties and board sizes, also different GUI designs  
Then there's multiplayer modes or 1v1 or vs computer
