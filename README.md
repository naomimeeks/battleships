## Naomi Explaining the complicatedness of her code lol:
So basically I've broken down the code a little bit and made it more complicated in some ways. I have used these things called classes which basically group variables and functions into 'objects', So currently there is a 'board' class and a 'square' class. This makes it so there can be different instances of 'board' for example, with different names but that have things like board size inside them (they can then be different if needed) and it basically is the most code efficient and pretty way to do it in my opinion. If you google object oriented programming it should be pretty easy to find some stuff to explain it (or chatgpt lol).  
If people want to have another go at implementing the pygame stuff absolutely feel free, there will of course be other ways to do it but I think this way is the cleanest (and will hopefully get us quite a few marks). This is currently working pretty well, the computer has turns after uyou click a square and things change colour depending on hits etc etc. It's also looking kind of pretty (thanks to Annan :).
I've also used these things called 2D arrays, which are basically lists but more 2 dimensional, for the boards which again makes it a bit easier to do some of the stuff with. But for this you need to install this thing called numpy. When you install IDLE, you need to go to the console and type 'pip install nump'y and also 'pip install pygame' and then the code should run pretty nicely.  
Also, in terms of using the github, I think the best way to do it is take the code to work on from the main brance and then to create a branch each and commit the changes you make in the code to your branch and then we can go through and merge them and make it all work together.  
### In summary
1) When writing new code, please use the code from the main branch and then save (commit) or upload your code to your own branch
3) I've made this a little complicated but I think we should stick with it, it's working pretty well
4) I've used classes and 2D arrays
5) To run the code, you'll need to install pygame and numpy
6) Please save/commit changes into your own branch

Hope that's okay with everyone and please give me a shout if anything glaringly doesn't make sense :)
